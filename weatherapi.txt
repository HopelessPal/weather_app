1. take the location of the user
2. show the weather of the user from the current location:
	i. the weather things are taken from the console where each attribute is taken from it's keyword.
	ii. for eg. we take the latitude and the longitude from the console menu and then input the lat and long to the desired areas in order to show the location.
3. we can use the search functionality to show the weather of other cities but then we gotta update all the attributes like the wind speed and all to the specifiedd areas


                                                    OR

we can just make a new page which would show us all the data whether be it today or some other day
can i make it though is the question.


breaking it down into parts and then working on it

1. firstly I have to customise the search bar and make it so that it doesn't close on clicking the search bar and instead it should close when I press the close button.
2. and then I have to change the function of the search bar's search icon such that I can use the search function which should not be that hard.
